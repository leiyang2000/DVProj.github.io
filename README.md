This project is a visual exploration of the history and impact of HIV/AIDS over the past 30 years. It utilizes data visualization to convey the scale of the epidemic, trends over time, and the ongoing challenges in combating the virus.



## Project Overview

The website includes several interactive visualizations that cover various aspects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, such as new cases, death rates, and demographic impacts. Each visualization is designed to provide a deeper understanding of the disease's dynamics and its socio-economic effects.

### Visualizations Included:

- **New Cases of HIV/AIDS**: Trends in the incidence of HIV, measured as the number of new cases per 1,000 individuals, using data from UNAIDS and IHME, Global Burden of Disease estimates.
- **Death Rates Across Geographies**: Interactive map showing the distribution of AIDS-related death rates worldwide, with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa.
- **Trends Over the Decades**: Historical data showing the increase in people infected with HIV and dying from the disease since the 1990s.
- **Impact on Youth**: Analysis of how HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects younger demographics, particularly those aged 15 to 49 years.
- **Gender and Racial Disparities in AIDS Deaths**: Exploration of how HIV/AIDS has impacted different demographic groups in the United States, including a focus on gender and racial disparities.

## Technologies Used

- **Vega-Lite**: For creating interactive and responsive visualizations.
- **Pure.css**: For layout and styling to ensure the site is visually appealing and accessible on all devices.
- **Google Fonts**: To enhance textual content readability and aesthetics.
